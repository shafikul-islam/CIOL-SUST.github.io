        <b>TL;DR: </b>
        This paper introduces a real-world graph dataset empowering researchers to leverage GNNs for supply chain problem-solving, enhancing production planning capabilities, with benchmark scores on six homogeneous graph tasks.

            Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

          <p>Our dataset’s structural design models products as nodes, while the
            interrelationships, such as shared product groups, subgroups, production
            facilities, and storage locations, are represented as edge connections.
            This dataset equips us to apply GNNs to complex supply chain
            predicaments, such as:<br><strong>Supply chain planning</strong> involves the utilization of historical data
            pertaining to production and demand as node attributes, with the
            integration of time-related features to capture seasonality and trends.
            To enhance demand forecasting accuracy, related entities’ influence can
            be harnessed through neighborhood nodes. The hierarchical structure of
            nodes, including product groups, subgroups, plants, and storage
            locations, can be used for hierarchy-aware forecasting. In data-scarce
            scenarios, improved forecasting can be achieved by applying transfer
            learning across nodes of the same classification.<br><strong>Product Classification</strong> involves classifying products by product
            groups, sub-groups, facilities; and also by economic profitability and
            production similarities for economic decision-making.<br><strong>Product Relation Classification</strong> involves classifying or predicting
            product relations in the supply chain graph. Product Relation detection
            involves detecting a missing edge or relation in the supply chain graph
            by a binary prediction objective.<br><strong>Supply chain optimization</strong> involves modeling goods flow between
            nodes, considering demand, lead times, and reorder points. Optimal
            routes and quantities can be recommended using edges as transportation
            links. Nodes representing plants can also aid in suggesting production
            adjustments based on demand projections, constraints, and capacity.<br><strong>Anomaly detection</strong> is achieved by contrasting predicted demand with
            actual data to identify disruptions, stockouts, or unusual demand
            spikes. Deviations in demand from aggregated neighborhood demand can
            signal inconsistencies within neighborhoods, which can be detected as
            anomalies.<br><strong>Event classification</strong> involves the training of GNNs to classify
            events based on edges and nodes, such as production capacity changes,
            new product launches, and disruptions.<br><strong>Fluctuation Detection</strong> entails training GNNs to identify and classify
            fluctuations in the network based on impacts of global price hikes,
            supply chain issues, and disruptions. Fluctuations in supply chains
            refer to disruptions that can occur due to various factors and can
            significantly impact the operations of businesses. These disruptions can
            amplify negative shocks, affecting not just the firm experiencing the
            failure, but also its suppliers and customers, and even firms in other
            parts of the production network . Using temporal data, the model can
            recognize patterns in these fluctuations over time and determine if any
            demand and supply fluctuation can occur in near future for better
            planning.<br><strong>Combinatorial</strong> and <strong>Constrained</strong> <strong>Optimization</strong> involves
            utilizing GNNs to optimize complex decision-making within the supply
            chain, considering various factors and constraints. GNNs can effectively
            model the intricate relationships between nodes and edges, enabling
            efficient allocation of resources, route planning, and inventory
            management, ultimately leading to improved performance.</p>
